Robert: “Oh my gosh, oh my GOSH! What just happened?! Where am I?!”
Unknown Man: “HELLO!!”
Robert: “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!”
Unknown Man: “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!”
Robert: “W-what, no, who--who are you?!”
Unknown Man: “Jumpin' Jehosaphat, boy! Please don't scare me like that again. My old heart can't take it!”
Robert: “Scare YOU? You're the one who just popped out of nowhere!”
Unknown Man: “Oh? Well, I guess I did try to introduce myself rather suddenly. Though I never thought of myself as intimidating....”
Robert: “Huh? Who in the world are you?”
Unknown Man: “Oh yes, of course. Let me introduce myself. My name is Erwin Schrodinger.”
Robert: “... Schrodinger? You're named after that famous physicist?”
Schrodinger: “...In a manner of speaking.”
Robert: “Huh?”
Schrodinger: “I'm THE Erwin Schrodinger, physicist extraordinaire.”
Robert: “No, you're not.”
Schrodinger: “Yes, I am.”
Robert: “No, you're NOT.”
Schrodinger: “My name IS Erwin Schrodinger, and I AM a physicist. So I‘m afraid that statement is quite false.”
Robert: “You're saying you're THAT Schrodinger? The dead-and-alive-cat-experiment Schrodinger?”
Schrodinger: “Yes. I am that Schrodinger. Though I have to admit, I am a bit tired of hearing about that darn cat all the time....”
Robert: “Um, yeah, sorry. But...how? How are you here? Why are you here? And why am I here?”
Schrodinger: “One question at a time, boy. Well, I guess there's no easy way to say this, so I'll just be blunt: I'm the one who brought you here.”
Robert : “WHAT!!!? Why?! Why would you do that--”
Schrodinger: “I needed help! Something horrible has happened, and I have been trying to fix it, but I'm not as young as I used to be, and--”
Robert: “What in the world are you talking about?! What problem?!”
Schrodinger: “It all happened quite a long time ago... I was a prominent physicist. Doing my studies, research, reaching new heights.”
Schrodinger: “But then IT happened....”
Robert: “What? What happened?”
Schrodinger: “The emergence of “quantum” physics! I've always hated the concept. It just seems so--so outlandish! So one day, I took matters into my own hands.”
Schrodinger: “I performed an experiment, one meant to insult the theories of quantum mechanics. I put a cat in a box along with a flask of poison and a radioactive source.”
Schrodinger: “If any amount of radiation were detected, even so much as a single atom, the poison would be released, and the cat would die.”
Schrodinger: “According to the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically Copenhagen's Principle, the cat should have been simultaneously alive AND dead.”
Robert: “Yeah, I know. Even I've heard of Schrodinger's cat; it's famous.”
Schrodinger: “No, you don't understand!”
Robert: “Huh?”
Schrodinger: “The experiment created a paradox. The cat was...unstable, being both alive and dead. As a result of this unnatural state, the cat was given God-like powers, achieving a state of near-omnipotence!”
Schrodinger: “In a vengeful rage, the cat thrust me and my entire lab into an alternate dimension. The very dimension you are now in. I've been here for years, trying to discover a way back to our world.”
Schrodinger: “But the cat stops me at every turn. And the years are starting to take a toll on my mind....”
Schrodinger : “The cat may be able to stop me from leaving, but it never expected me to bring someone in, so that's what I did. I brought you here to help me defeat the cat.”
Robert: “And how exactly am I supposed to that?”
Schrodinger: “You are an anomaly. You were drawn to my quantum disturbance. You were at the correct place, at the correct time. That is exactly what I was looking for, and I found it, er, you.”
Robert: “I don't follow.”
Schrodinger: “Let me see, how can I simplify this...? Some things in the world are universal facts. They exist because they exist.”
Schrodinger: “They are as much a part of this universe as matter, gravity, atoms, etc. You, young man, are a universal fact. Because of this, the cat has trouble manipulating you.”
Robert: “I still don't get it.”
Schrodinger: “It means that you are--by the way, what's your name?”
Robert: “Uh, Robert.”
Schrodinger: “Yes, well, it means, Robert, that you are the only one who can save this world, and every other world the cat will endanger.”
Robert: “Listen, that's a pretty neat story. But do you really expect me to believe that? I mean, a God-Cat! Do you know how silly that sounds--”
Cat: “Schrodingerrrrr....”
Schrodinger: “Oh no! The cat must've caught on to my plan! Hurry, you must leave! It's come here for you! Here, take this!”
Robert: “What? You mean that cat's REAL?!!? What do I do?!”
Schrodinger: “OPEN THAT BOX, THE GREEN ONE!!”
Robert : “WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO DO?!”
Schrodinger: “No time to explain, just do it! And take this, too!”
