Robert: “W-What?!
Robert: “What in the world is this?”
S Radio: “Robert! Robert! Can you hear me?? "
Robert: “Hello, Dr. Schrodinger? What just happened?! Are you ok? Where’s the cat?”
S Radio: “Phew! I’m glad to hear you made it through alright! I had to make those calculations on the fly. I’m just fine. The cat disappeared right after you jumped through the portal.”
Robert: “That’s good. So, where am I now?”
S Radio: “Oh, right. I was going to explain this, but that darned cat interrupted us.”
Robert: “Go on.”
S Radio: “This world has been put in quite the bind. The aspects of classical physics have been shattered. Chaos has run amok. Order needs to be restored."
Robert: “What does that have to do with me?””
S Radio: “The cat has “enlisted” several generals to maintain the quantum chaos throughout the world—famous physicists who were pulled from their respective time periods and brainwashed.”
S Radio: “You need to go complete their trials and defeat them in order to restore order to their section of the world.”
Robert: “…That makes no sense whatsoever.”
S Radio: “Listen, I’M famous physicist here. Just do it.”
Robert: “Well, I don’t really have much of a choice here, do I?”
S Radio: “No, not really. :)”
Robert: “Right. Well, let’s just have a look around here... Hmmm, space stuff. Some sort of galaxy maybe?”
Robert: “Wait a minute, these planets look familiar....”
Robert: “Woah, this seems pretty old... Huh? There’s writing on it.”
Robert: “Hey, I found a key!”
S Radio: “Ahhh, yes. That’s a quantum key.”
Robert: “A what?”
S Radio: “In order for me to unlock the door-shaped portal to the next trial, I need to hone in on that area’s quantum signature. That key provides the signature.”
Robert: “And that means....?”
S Radio: *sigh* “It’s a key that lets you get to the next level.”
Robert: “Oh. Gotcha.”
